REQUIREMENTS

build-essential
libsqlite3-dev

BUILD

Type `make'.
You'd better not install this library, it could make your system highly unstable.

USAGE

Please make a backup copy of your /var/lib/dpkg/info directory before using tdpkg.

LD_PRELOAD="./libtdpkg.so" dpkg ...

BENCHMARKING

The operations involved with dpkg database reading are mostly done on the file system.
For this reason cleaning up the kernel cache is a must before calling either tdpkg or dpkg:

echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
